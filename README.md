Improved & revised version of TheAppBrewery Python Flash Card App

- Flash cards have not been edited greatly / Translation inaccuracies / People names
- Not a finished product, just a templated product for learning sake.

**TODO's:**

- Add word count for each selected library
- Refactor code into class files for ease of access/viewing
- Add sound effects for remembered words
- Add more languages + words
- Translation proofing
- Add target goal
- Add daily word amount
- Eventually create a minigame with highscore system
